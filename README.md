# Sokoban Solver with AI & Graphical Interface

A **Sokoban** puzzle game with both manual play and AI solvers, implemented in Python using **Pygame**.  
This project features **deadlock detection**, multiple solving algorithms (**A***, **BFS**, **DFS**), solution visualization, and customizable themes.

---

## Game Goal
Sokoban is a classic puzzle game where a player pushes boxes onto designated goal squares inside a maze.
- **Win Condition**: All boxes are placed on the goal tiles.
- **Movement Constraints**:
  - Boxes can **only be pushed**, not pulled.
  - The player cannot walk through walls or boxes.
- The challenge lies in avoiding **deadlock states** where the puzzle becomes unsolvable.

## Project Goals
- Implement **AI algorithms** capable of solving Sokoban efficiently.
- Compare solver performance using metrics such as **execution time** and **nodes explored**.
- Explore **game-specific optimizations** such as deadlock detection and heuristics.
- Provide a **graphical interface** for both manual play and solver visualization.

##  Features

### AI Solvers
- **A***, **BFS**, and **DFS** search algorithms.
- Performance statistics: execution time, explored nodes.
- **Heuristics**:
  - **Manhattan distance**: sum of shortest grid distances from each box to the nearest goal.
  - **Euclidean distance**: direct-line distance; faster to compute but less tight.
  - **Hungarian algorithm**: computes an optimal box-to-goal assignment to minimize total distance.

### Deadlock Detection
Deadlocks are identified **before exploring a state** to prune the search space. Implemented detectors include:
1. **Corner Deadlock** ‚Äî Detects boxes stuck in a non-goal corner (two perpendicular walls).
2. **Wall Deadlock** ‚Äî Identifies boxes pushed along walls into positions that cannot reach any goal.
3. **Tunnel Deadlock** ‚Äî Flags boxes in narrow passages where movement is impossible unless already on a goal.
4. **Freeze Deadlock** ‚Äî Detects clusters of adjacent boxes that mutually block each other from reaching any goal.
5. **Static Dead Squares** ‚Äî Precomputed unreachable-from-goal positions, used to prevent placing boxes there at all.

These checks are integrated directly into the **successor generation phase**, ensuring early pruning.

## Technical Design

### **State Representation**
Each state is modeled as:
States are stored exactly as in the `SokobanState` class (coordinates are `(x, y)` where `x` is column and `y` is row):

```python
# Core fields
self.grid: List[List[str]]          # mutable board; characters '#', '@', '$', '.', '*', ' '
self.player: Tuple[int, int]        # (x, y)
self.boxes: Set[Tuple[int, int]]    # parsed from '$' and '*'
self.goals: Set[Tuple[int, int]]    # parsed from '.' and '*'
self.empty_spaces: Set[Tuple[int,int]]   # ' ' cells (used to precompute dead squares)
self.dead_squares: Set[Tuple[int,int]]   # computed once from layout
```

- Walls and goals are parsed from `grid` at init. Walls are queried via `is_wall(x, y)`, while `goals` are kept as a separate set and overlaid during rendering.
- Boxes are stored as a **mutable `set`**. An invariant ordering is applied **only for hashing/equality** by sorting the set, which keeps updates cheap while ensuring identical layouts hash the same.
- Player coordinates are `(x, y)`.


**Hashing** is critical for detecting revisited states efficiently:
```python
    def __hash__(self):
        # Use sorted boxes for invariant state representation
        return hash((self.player, tuple(sorted(self.boxes))))
```

### **Search Algorithm Framework**
- **BFS**: Guaranteed to find the shortest solution but memory-heavy.
- **DFS**: Memory-efficient but may get stuck in deep branches.
- **A***: Uses heuristics to prioritize promising states; best choice for large levels.

All solvers share a **push-based successor generator**:
- Compute player-reachable tiles without moving boxes.
- For each reachable adjacent box, simulate a push if the target square is free and not a dead square.
- Apply **deadlock checks** immediately after the push.

### **Heuristic Design**
1. **Manhattan Distance Sum** ‚Äî lower bound on pushes required.
2. **Euclidean Distance Sum** ‚Äî cheaper alternative.
3. **Hungarian Algorithm** ‚Äî solves the optimal box-goal matching problem in O(n¬≥) for tighter estimates.

The heuristics are **admissible**, ensuring **A*** finds optimal solutions.
