# Sokoban Solver with AI & Graphical Interface

A **Sokoban** puzzle game with both manual play and AI solvers, implemented in Python using **Pygame**.  
This project features **deadlock detection**, multiple solving algorithms (**A\***, **BFS**, **DFS**), solution visualization, and customizable themes.

## üïπÔ∏è Game Goal
Sokoban is a logic puzzle where the player pushes boxes onto goal positions.
- **You win** when **all boxes** are placed on the goal tiles.
- Boxes can **only be pushed**, not pulled.
- The player cannot walk through walls or boxes.
- The challenge lies in avoiding **deadlock states** where the puzzle becomes unsolvable.

## üéØ Project Goals
The aim of this project is to:
- Implement **AI algorithms** capable of solving Sokoban efficiently.
- Compare solver performance using metrics like **execution time** and **nodes explored** between different algorithms.
- Explore **game-specific optimizations** such as deadlock detection and heuristics.
- Provide a **graphical interface** for interactive play and AI solution visualization.

## üì¶ Features
